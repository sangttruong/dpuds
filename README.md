# Elements-of-Statistical-Learning

This is my attempt to explore machine learning and data mining from a statistical perspective (which I feel just a bit more comfortable with). Here are the learning materials: 
* Stanford online course: https://online.stanford.edu/courses/sohs-ystatslearning-statistical-learning-self-paced
* An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Application in R: http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/ 
* Unofficial Key of An Introduction ot Statistical Learning: http://blog.princehonest.com/stat-learning/
* The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction: https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/

The upload files are homework from chapter 1 to 10 in the books. 

# Introductio to Statistical Computing

This is a class I took at DePauw University. Below is the course description. I upload my homework in this repository: 
This course is designed to provide students with an introduction to statistical computing using RStudio. This course will have two components. In the first part of the course, students will learn data manipulations, data structures, matrix manipulation, database operation, and functions. In the second part of the course, students will learn statistical computing topics including simulation studies and Monte Carlo methods, numerical optimization, Bootstrap resampling methods, and visualization. Students will be introduced to some packages and technologies that are useful for statistical computing. Through producing numerical summaries and creating customized graphs, students will be able to discuss the results obtained from their analyses and to generate dynamic and reproducible documents.
