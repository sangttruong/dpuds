# Detecting Smoker and Quitter: Statistical and Deep Learning approaches

A few year ago, I wrote a paper called "The Effect of Education on Smoking behavior in America." In this paper, I used probit regression to model the relationship between smoking and quitting (both are binary) and other social-economic factors. I selected about 10 explanatory variables based on several economic theories for my models. The best model had adjusted-R square about 20%. The result was very interesting, so interesting that it helps me won a "best presentation" prize in a conference.

Recently I came across this paper again. I wonder what happen if I apply some deep-learning framework that I read about lately in this dataset. Do you think deep-learning can beat traditional statistical approach in this dataset? 

I'm still working on this. Let me know if you are interested and I will keep you posted.
