# Introduction to Statistical Learning in R

Introduction to Statistical Learning in R (ISLR) explores the theories behind some common machine learning methods from statistical approach. Topics of the class cover: 

* Linear regressors and logistic regression
* Local Regression and Generalized Additive Models
* Linear discriminant analysis and Bayes theorem
* Decision trees and random forests
* Support vector machine
* k-mean clustering and hierachial clustering
* Model selection: k-fold, cross validation, forward, backward, shrinkage (ridge and lasso), information criteria (AIC, BIC) 
* Boostrap resampling

# Introductio to Statistical Computing: MATH 348

I took MATH 348 at DePauw University during Spring 2019. The topics of this class include:
* Data manipulation and database operation
* Monte - Carlo simulation
* Boostrap resampling
* Data visualization
* Numerical optimization
