# Introduction to Statistical Learning in R

This is my attempt to explore machine learning and data mining from a statistical perspective (which I feel just a bit more comfortable with). Here are the learning materials: 
* Stanford online course: https://online.stanford.edu/courses/sohs-ystatslearning-statistical-learning-self-paced
* An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Application in R: http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/ 
* Unofficial Key of An Introduction ot Statistical Learning: http://blog.princehonest.com/stat-learning/
* The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction: https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/

The upload files are homework from chapter 1 to 10 in the books. 

# Introductio to Statistical Computing

This is a class I took at DePauw University. This is where I first learn R and RStudio. The topics in this class include:
* Data manipulation and database operation
* Monte - Carlo simulation
* Boostrap resampling
* Data visualization
* Numerical optimization
