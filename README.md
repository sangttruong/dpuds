# Introduction to Statistical Learning in R

Introduction to Statistical Learning in R (ISLR) explores the theories behind some common machine learning methods from statistical approach. Topics of the class cover: 

* Linear regressors and logistic regression
* Local Regression and Generalized Additive Models
* Linear discriminant analysis and Bayes theorem
* Decision trees and random forests
* Support vector machine
* k-mean clustering and hierachial clustering
* Model selection: k-fold, cross validation, forward, backward, shrinkage (ridge and lasso), information criteria (AIC, BIC) 
* Boostrap resampling

# Introduction to Statistical Computing: MATH 348

I took MATH 348 at DePauw University during Spring 2019. The topics of this class include:
* Data manipulation and database operation
* Monte Carlo simulation
* Boostrap resampling
* Data visualization
* Numerical optimization

# Monte Carlo Method for Molecular Modeling: CHEM 395

Due to my interest in statistics, computing, and biochemistry, I design this class. Topics of this class include: 
* Random number generator
* Monte Carlo optimization (numerical optimization, stochastic search, stochastic approximation)
* Metropolis–Hastings Algorithms and Markov chain theory
* The use of molecular modelling and cheminformatics to discover and design new molecules

# Deep Learning with R

François Chollet and J.J. Allaire wrote a book to introduce deep learning in R. I probably will spend Chrismas this year on this book (hopefully if I won't lose all my time in the family gathering ... )

# Numerical Linear Algebra
This course: https://github.com/fastai/numerical-linear-algebra/blob/master/README.md. 

Great class to learn about linear algebra... I need to review it soon too... Just a bit busy these days ...
